--------------------------------------------------------------UNDERSTANDING CLEAN CODE---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What Clean Code means

Clean code is code that’s easy to read, easy to modify, and does what is expected with no surprises.

It’s as important as performance or avoiding bugs, because developers spend much more time reading code than writing it.

The idea: write code for humans first, not just machines.

2. Why write clean code

Saves time and effort over the long run.

Makes maintenance and collaboration easier.

Helps prevent bugs when code needs to be updated or reused.

3. Practical principles
The article suggests some straightforward rules to write cleaner code:

👉 Naming

Use intention-revealing names so the purpose is immediately clear.

Names should be pronounceable and searchable.

Avoid ambiguous abbreviations, prefixes/suffixes and meaningless names.

👉 Functions

One function should do only one thing and do it well.

Keep functions small and with limited indentation (e.g., max 2 levels).

Prefer fewer arguments (ideally 0–2) to reduce cognitive load.

👉 Comments

Avoid comments that explain what code does — use good naming and structure instead.

Comments often become outdated or misleading.

Only keep comments when they add real value (e.g., TODOs, legal notes, or rationale).

4. Refactoring

Refactoring (reworking code structure without changing behavior) is key to cleaning code.

Examples of safe refactors include extracting functions, renaming identifiers, and creating constants.

Having automated tests and IDE refactoring tools makes this safe and practical.

5. When to refactor

Refactor often — ideally at the end of every small development cycle.

Write code, write tests, then clean it up.


👨‍💻 Clean Coding Practices in Java
📁 1. Project Structure

Follow a consistent directory layout (e.g., Maven’s src/main/java, src/test/java).

Even if you don’t use a specific build tool, a clear structure helps others navigate the project.

🏷 2. Naming Conventions

Good names enhance readability:

Classes → Nouns representing real-world concepts

Methods → Verbs describing actions

Variables → Names that reveal intent

Use standard Java conventions (camelCase, etc.).

📄 3. Source File Structure

Organize code within a Java file for clarity:

Typical order:

Package

Imports (static then non-static)

Class

Fields

Constructors

Methods

↔ 4. Whitespace and Layout

Well-placed blank lines and consistent spacing improve readability, such as:

Separate logical blocks with blank lines

Use consistent spaces around keywords

Group related code visually

➿ 5. Indentation

Use consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces or tabs).

Break long expressions logically for readability.

🔢 6. Method Parameters

Avoid long parameter lists (prefer max ~3).

If a method needs many inputs, consider grouping them into a custom object.

Long parameter lists often indicate a method does too much.

💡 7. Avoid Hardcoding

Instead of literal values:

Use constants or enums

Or fetch values from configs/environment
This makes code easier to change and less error-prone.

📝 8. Code Comments

Use comments judiciously:

JavaDoc for public APIs (what does a method do, parameters, etc.)

Implementation comments only for non-obvious design decisions
If code needs too many comments to be understood, the code itself likely needs refactoring.

📊 9. Logging

Good logging aids debugging, but avoid over-logging:

Choose appropriate levels (info, debug, etc.)

Provide context in log messages
Useful for troubleshooting without clutter.

🎯 Fundamental Principles Often Used with Clean Code
⚙ SOLID Principles

These help structure maintainable OOP code:

Single Responsibility

Open/Closed

Liskov Substitution

Interface Segregation

Dependency Inversion

🔁 DRY & KISS

DRY — Don’t Repeat Yourself (reduce duplication)

KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid (favor simplicity)

🔄 TDD (Test-Driven Development)

Write tests before code:

Ensures code does what it should

Encourages simpler, testable design
Common practice alongside clean code efforts.

🛠 Tools That Help Enforce Clean Code

Clean coding practices can be supported by tools:

Formatters (IDE auto-format)

Static analysis (Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs, SonarQube)

Code reviews for feedback and consistency

🔚 Summary







Naming Conventions in Java :
Naming conventions are a set of guidelines that define how to name identifiers such as classes, 
variables, methods, constants and packages in a uniform and meaningful way. These conventions help ensure clarity, 
reduce confusion, and maintain coding standards across projects and teams.

Why Naming Conventions Are Important
Improves readability
Makes maintenance easier
Reduces confusion for developers
Helps new team members understand code faster
Note: Java widely follows the CamelCase style, where names are formed by joining multiple words and capitalizing each internal word.

Types of Java Naming Conventions
Java defines clear rules for naming classes, methods, variables, packages, and constants. These conventions keep the code organized and self-explanatory.

1. Classes and Interfaces
Classes Should be nouns and written in PascalCase (each word starts with a capital letter).
Names should be descriptive and meaningful.
Acronyms and unclear abbreviations should be avoided.
class Student { }
class Integer { }
class Scanner { }

Interfaces Should also follow PascalCase.
Interface names often represent capabilities or behaviors.
interface Runnable { }
interface Remote { }
interface Serializable { }

2. Methods 
Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase and with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.

public static void main(String [] args)  {}

Note: The main() method follows this rule and acts as the entry point of a Java program.

3. Variables
Variable names should be short yet meaningful. 

Variable names should not start with underscore _ or dollar sign $ characters, even though both are allowed.

Should be mnemonic i.e, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use.
One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary variables.
Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m and n for integers; c, d and e for characters.
int[] marks;

double answer,

Note: As the name suggests one stands for marks while the other for an answer be it of any e do not mind.

4. Constant variables
Should be written in all uppercase, with words separated by underscores (e.g., MAX_SIZE, PI_VALUE)
Common constants are found in classes like Float, Long, String, etc.
final double PI = 3.14159; 
double num = PI;

5. Packages
Always written in lowercase, even when they contain multiple words.
Follow the reverse domain naming convention: com, org, edu, net, etc.
Sub-packages follow the organization’s internal structure.
import java.util.Scanner ;
import java.io.*;

In the above examples:

java.util gives access to the Scanner class.
java.io.* imports all input-output related classes.

Clean code is more than formatting — it’s about writing Java that’s:
✅ Readable
✅ Maintainable
✅ Simple
✅ Testable
